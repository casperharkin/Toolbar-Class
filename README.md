Toolbar and Menu Class (Think like Office 2016 tabbed menu look)


I have a menu design that I like using with my GUIs (Think like Office 2016 tabbed menu look).

I got sick of recreating it for each GUI, so I tried my hand at making it into a reusable class.

Maybe someone here will have a use for it.
